1. problem1. Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

    Write a program that counts up the number of vowels contained in the string s. Valid vowels are: 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u'.
For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', your program should print:
    ```
    Number of vowels: 5
    ```
1. problem2. Assume s is a string of lower case characters.

    Write a program that prints the number of times the string 'bob' occurs in s. 
    For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print
    ```
    Number of times bob occurs is: 2
    ```
1. problem3(Add refactoring to imporove readability). Assume s is a string of lower case characters.Write a program that prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in alphabetical order. For example, if s = 'azcbobobegghakl', then your program should print Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh. In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if s = 'abcbcd', then your program should print:
    ```
    Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc
    ```
